# About this repository 

This repository has c++ scripts based on data structure studies.

- Each .cpp file is a script grouping studies of one week from the UNIVESP college "data structure" course.
- Each script is a .cpp file and has a sequence of function studying some subjects.
- To see and understand this functions, you should copy the function call and paste it in the "main()" function of the .cpp file. All the functions already is located in each "main()" function of that scripts.

# How to execute
